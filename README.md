# Accident Prediction on National Highways in India

This is an attempt for development of Accident prediction model to determine the impact
of increasing Accident rate in the High Speed Corridors on the Economy of India. The loss
incurred due to the Accidents is relatively very more compared to the development of Indian
Economy. For instance, the Quarterly GDP by September 2010 is 8.40% but the loss due to the
occurrence of Accident is about 3%. The above details show how the Accidents are retarding the
development of Indian Economy. For the same, it was proposed to generate “Accident prediction
Model” for the High Speed Corridors in India and to work out the loss suffered due to the
Accidents by giving a suitable rate for each type of Accidents.
